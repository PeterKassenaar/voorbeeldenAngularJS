# Hands on Angular 2

Intention of this project is to create hello world app in Angular 2.

For the sake of quickstart I recommend using the [quickstart GitHub repository](https://github.com/angular/quickstart). This repository provides a faster start than building from npm. This repository includes Angular and dependencies to compile ES6 in incompatible browsers.

I cloned repo into quickstart directory at root for simplicity.
